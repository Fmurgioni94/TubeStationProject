This Python project showcases the application of two key algorithms, Dijkstra's and Kruskal's, to analyze and optimize a transportation network. The graph represents a network of stations, and the program computes the shortest paths and minimum spanning tree (MST) for various operations.

The project first applies Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest paths between stations based on time and stops, showing optimal routing within the network. Kruskal's algorithm is then used to create an MST, simplifying the network to the essential edges while minimizing the total weight. The results of Dijkstra's algorithm are then compared before and after the MST, providing insights into the efficiency gained by reducing redundant connections.

Additionally, the program explores the connectivity of the network using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm and identifies which edges can be removed without affecting the overall connectivity.

This project highlights how classic graph theory algorithms can be used to model and optimize real-world networks, with a focus on transportation.
